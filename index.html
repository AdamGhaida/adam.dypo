                                <h1>Feeling Scratchy</h1><br>Bored on a sunny Lebanese summer day, I asked my
                                father for something to do, and was introduced to <a
                                    href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu">scratch</a>. Here, I learned so much about the
                                essential foundations of programming and computational thought. Little did I know that
                                the rest of my life would be spent in the world of code.<br><br>What I learned from
                                scratch was that I loved to create things, and that I loved to learn. I created so many
                                games and animations, and I was hooked. Sprites became a part of my life, and I was in
                                love with the idea of creating something from nothing.

                                <h1>Snakes in Boots</h1><br>In 2015, I completed a <a
                                    href="ADD Course section">course</a> from Pirean Data on python and learned
                                everything from the ground up. I built so many programs and wasted so much time on IDLE
                                creating adventure games and console games. I was in love with the idea of creating
                                something from nothing. I was hooked.<br><br>Leaving what felt like an impractical
                                platform like scratch to Python was a big step, but I was so happy to have taken it. I
                                learned so much about the world of programming, and I was so happy to have taken that
                                step and pushing myself further than I thought I could go.

                                <h1>App Dev</h1><br>Around 2017, I started to get really interested in app development,
                                and to that end, I learned <b>Swift, Flutter, SwiftUI, Bootstrap, and Dart.</b> In
                                December of 2019, I landed a
                                keynote presentation at <b>Apple's</b> Today@Apple program as a guest speaker talking
                                about my
                                journey into iOS app development and helped audience members create their very first
                                app!
                                <br><br>I also founded the IDJ, an online platform of iOS developers who help each other
                                get
                                started and answer any questions they might have. I learned so much about leadership and
                                inclusion while fulfilling that role.

                                <br>While I was in quarantine, I realized that what I truly felt passion for was
                                Education. I wanted to help spread the knowledge and skills I accumulated over years of
                                hard work and dedication to as much people as I could.<br><br> I joined dozens of online
                                communities over discord and started teaching a class around the foundations of
                                programming and spent hours shaping the curriculum to each student in the class. It was
                                truly an incredible thing to be part of. Education is the future, and I'm so excited to
                                be a part of it and I'm incredibly excited to leverage computer science to create an
                                impact.

                                that is at the forefront of assesments and ed-tech globally. During my internship, I was

                                provided feedback from a student presprective only being 16 years old.<br><br>What
                                Massarat taught me was that the real world was not different than my desk. I learned
                                that I could affect change in my community from my study desk and that I didn't need a
